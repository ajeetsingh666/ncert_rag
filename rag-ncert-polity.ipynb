In a democratic country, the Constitution serves several important purposes:\n\n1. Establishes the framework of government: The Constitution sets out the structure of the government, including the separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. This helps to ensure that no one branch of government has too much power and that the system of checks and balances is in place.\n2. Defines the powers of government: The Constitution defines the specific powers of each branch of government and limits the powers of the federal government. This helps to prevent the government from abusing its power and ensuring that the rights of citizens are protected.\n3. Protects individual rights and freedoms: The Constitution includes a bill of rights that outlines the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens, such as freedom of speech, religion, and the press. This helps to protect citizens from government interference and ensures that they have the ability to express themselves and participate in the democratic process.\n4. Provides a basis for the rule of law: The Constitution establishes the rule of law, which means that all citizens are subject to the same laws and regulations. This helps to ensure that the government and citizens are held accountable for their actions and that the legal system is fair and impartial.\n5. Provides a mechanism for amending the Constitution: The Constitution includes a process for amending it, which allows the document to be updated and modified as needed. This helps to ensure that the Constitution remains relevant and effective over time.\n\nIn summary, a democratic country needs a Constitution to establish the framework of government, define the powers of government, protect individual rights and freedoms, provide a basis for the rule of law, and provide a mechanism for amending the Constitution.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings\n# Define the path to the pre-trained model you want to use\nmodelPath = \"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-l6-v2\"\n\n# Create a dictionary with model configuration options, specifying to use the CPU for computations\nmodel_kwargs = {'device':'cpu'}\n\n# Create a dictionary with encoding options, specifically setting 'normalize_embeddings' to False\nencode_kwargs = {'normalize_embeddings': False}\n\n# Initialize an instance of HuggingFaceEmbeddings with the specified parameters\nembeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(\n    model_name=modelPath,     # Provide the pre-trained model's path\n    model_kwargs=model_kwargs, # Pass the model configuration options\n    encode_kwargs=encode_kwargs # Pass the encoding options\n)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-03T18:04:04.580728Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-03T18:04:04.581097Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-03T18:04:10.806850Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-03T18:04:04.581067Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-03T18:04:10.805907Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/langchain_core/_api/deprecation.py:139: LangChainDeprecationWarning: The class `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` was deprecated in LangChain 0.2.2 and will be removed in 0.3.0.
