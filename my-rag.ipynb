The Constitution serves\\nseveral purposes. First, it lays out certain ideals that form\\nthe basis of the kind of country that we as citizens aspire to\\nlive in. Or, put another way, a Constitution tells us what\\nthe fundamental nature of our society is. A country is\\nusually made up of different communities of people who\\nshare certain beliefs but may not necessarily agree on all\\nissues. A Constitution helps serve as a set of rules and\\nprinciples that all persons in a country can agree upon as\\nthe basis of the way in which they want the country to be\\ngoverned. This includes not only the type of government\\nbut also an agreement on certain ideals  that they all believe\\nthe country should uphold.Why Does a Country Need a Constitution?\\n\\n9Similarly, the Constitution helps to protect us against\\ncertain decisions that we might take that could have an\\nadverse effect on the larger principles that the country\\nbelieves in. For example, it is possible that many people\\nwho live in a democracy might come to strongly feel that\\nparty politics has become so acrimonious that we need a\\nstrong dictator to set this right. Swept by this emotion,\\nthey may not realise that in the long run, dictatorial rule\\ngoes against all their interests. A good Constitution does\\nnot allow these whims to change its basic structure. It does\\nnot allow for the easy overthrow of provisions that\\nguarantee rights of citizens and protect their freedom.\\nFrom the above discussion, you will understand that the\\nConstitution plays a very important role in democratic\\nsocieties.The third significant reason why we need a Constitution\\nis to save us from ourselves. This may sound strange but\\nwhat is meant by this is that we might at times feel  strongly\\n\\nand the rules that would determine its functioning. This\\nwas done not by one person but by a group of around 300\\npeople who became members of the Constituent Assembly\\nin 1946 and who met periodically for the next three years\\nto write India’s Constitution.\\nThere was an extraordinary sense of unity\\namongst the members of the Constituent\\nAssembly. Each of the provisions of the future\\nconstitution was discussed in great detail and\\nthere was a sincere effort to compromise and\\nreach an agreement through consensus.
